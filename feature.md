##  Installmental Purchase Plan

### 1. **Concept**
 
Instead of paying the full price of a car at once, users can split the payment into smaller installments over **3 months, 6 months, or 12 months (1 year)**.

* Users make an initial deposit (e.g. first installment) when confirming the purchase.
* The remaining installments are auto-tracked and must be completed to finalize ownership.
* If payments are defaulted, rules apply (e.g. revoke booking, refund part, penalties).

---

### 2. **Business Rules**

* **Down Payment**: User must pay at least the first installment upfront.
* **Due Dates**: Fixed schedule based on plan (monthly cycle).
* **Missed Payments**:

* **Due Date Missed** â†’ Grace period of **7 days**.
* If payment not made within grace period â†’

  * Apply **0.3% of remaining balance** as penalty.
  * New balance will then be Remaining + Penalty.
* **If default continues until end of plan** â†’ Two options:

  1. **Request Extension:** Extend timeline with additional penalty interest.
  2. **Refund Request:** Refund amount already paid, but deduct **5â€“10% of car amount** as cancellation fee. 

  * **Completion**: Ownership only transfers after the last installment is cleared.
  
  ### these business rules are in place to protect protect the Enterprises' interest and to avoid tying down trading capital. also to encourage a level of commitment from the customers
